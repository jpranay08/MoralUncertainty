This repository contains the code for a research paper focused on addressing the problem of random credence in moral uncertainty. The paper proposes a novel approach that combines the simplex algorithm with the DS combination technique to solve the minimization problem.

## Contribution

In this paper, we contribute to the field by:

- **Utilizing the Simplex Algorithm:** We use the simplex algorithm due to its efficiency and effectiveness in finding optimal solutions for linear programming problems. Our objective is to minimize the total harm caused by autonomous systems in ethical dilemmas. The scalability of the simplex algorithm ensures it can handle increasingly complex scenarios as the scope of ethical considerations expands.

- **Leveraging the DS Combination Technique:** DS theory offers a powerful tool for handling uncertainty and making decisions in situations where credence values are randomly generated. By assigning belief masses to sets of outcomes, DS theory allows for the integration of diverse information to arrive at a more informed decision.

- **Demonstrating Superior Performance:** Our approach, which combines the simplex algorithm with the DS combination technique, has demonstrated superior performance compared to the random credence generation method used in existing models. This is evident in the results obtained, which serve as evidence for the effectiveness of our approach.

## Implementation Details

The implementation involves modeling a minimization linear problem based on moral theories with appropriate constraints. The simplex algorithm is then employed to solve this model, generating results that serve as evidence for the DS combination technique. This technique generates the plausibility of the theories, which is used as the credence in our framework.
